A Centinel library for use with Paypal (or any other payment gateway).  Originally built to work with django-paypal.

Sphinx docs for it which can be found in the docs folder and will get you started with config and setup.

This is a library which was originally written for a client who changed their payment gateway choice half way through a project (grr).  As such, the library hasn't been used extensively (and was half way through being refactored).  It was working prior to that however.

I haven't been back to it since, and I doubt I will as I don't have any api keys for Centinel.  It may prove useful as a starting point for someone so I'm throwing it open rather than letting it rot in a private repo.
